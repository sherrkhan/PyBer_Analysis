# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:

The main purpose of this data analysis is to extract visual representation of the trends in different city types with respect to Fare and Rides. In the following analysis we will see how the trends are made in a line representation and Pie Charts.


### Results

While analysing data with different types of cities on rides, drivers, Fares the following results are extracted 

#### Total Rides per City Type

From the above pie Chart it can be observed that urban takes the most area 68.4% of the total ride representation. 


#### Total Drivers per city type

From the above chart again we can see that urban drivers are more than the other two city types 


#### Total Fare per city type

Fromt the above line graph it can be see that the fares for collection by city is tha maximum and there is a huge gap within the lines of the graph. This represents the void in differnet city types. as the service with repect to the availaibility of drivers is low in subarban and Rural. While it can be the case that there is less demand but service should be provided. We can see the driver count is rural and subarban is far low than Urban. hence creating a gap 



### Summary

Based on the analysis we can provide following recommendation

- More drivers should be allocated to urban and subarban areas
- Differnet fare rate should be introduced in these areas to motivate riders to use Pyper 
- Incentive should be given to the drivers who are driving in specific neighbourhood at specific times
